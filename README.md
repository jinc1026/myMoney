# myMoney

This web app helps users to track spending habits and data is protected by Google Firebase. 

This project helped to me learn React JS and Google Firebase (Firestore, authentication and hosting).
The project is still in work in progress to add addtional features such as total amount, graph/chart, category and etc.

How to use:
1. First sign up using email and password
2. Log each spending history
